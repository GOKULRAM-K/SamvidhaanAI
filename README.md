## 🧠 Abstract
**SamvidhaanAI** is a legal chatbot designed to improve accessibility to the Indian Constitution using a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline powered by **Google's Gemini AI**. It uses semantic embeddings, ChromaDB for retrieval, and LangChain for orchestration, all presented via an interactive **Streamlit** interface. This AI-driven system aims to bridge the gap between citizens and complex legal information.

## 📌 Introduction
The Indian Constitution, while comprehensive, is challenging to interpret due to its:
- Dense legal language
- Massive structure with hundreds of articles and amendments

**SamvidhaanAI** solves this by offering a smart, conversational legal assistant built on modern AI, making constitutional knowledge interactive and easy to access.

---

## ❗ Problem Statement
Despite its importance, the Constitution faces limited usage due to:
- ⚖️ Complex legal jargon
- 📚 Enormous volume
- 🧩 Lack of intelligent, accessible tools for laypersons

---

## ✅ Our Solution
**SamvidhaanAI** offers:
- 🔍 **RAG Pipeline**: Combines retrieval + generation for grounded legal responses
- 🧠 **Semantic Embeddings**: Captures meaning beyond keywords
- 🧾 **Contextual Memory**: Maintains multi-turn conversations
- 💬 **Interactive Frontend**: Streamlit-powered user interface

---

## ⚙️ Technical Architecture

### 🧩 Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
- **Retriever**: Fetches top relevant document chunks
- **Generator**: Gemini AI creates coherent, fact-grounded responses

### 🧠 Embeddings
- Using embedding-001 from Google Generative AI
- Converts text to vectors for semantic matching

### 🗃️ Vector Store: ChromaDB
- ✅ Real-time similarity search
- 💾 Embedding persistence
- 🔗 Seamless with LangChain
- 🏠 Works offline (local hosting)

### 📐 Similarity Search
- **Cosine Similarity** with Top-k = 10
- Measures angle between vectors to find semantically closest chunks

### 🤖 Language Model: Gemini 1.5 Pro
- 🔍 Long-context understanding
- 🧾 Structured and formal outputs
- 🗣️ Supports future multilingual use
- 🚫 Reduced hallucination risk

---

## 🛠️ Implementation Steps
```text
1. Parse the Constitution PDF → split into 2000-character chunks (with overlap)
2. Generate embeddings for each chunk → store in ChromaDB
3. On user query → retrieve top 10 similar chunks
4. Feed context + query into Gemini → generate response
5. Display output in Streamlit → maintain session memory
```
